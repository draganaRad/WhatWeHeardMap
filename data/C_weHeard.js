        "location": "Coquitlam, Barnet heading east at Mariner",
        "description": "I get really frustrated by the drivers along Barnet heading east at Mariner and where it turns into Lougheed (by the bus depot) who use the very nicely marked green bike lanes as right turn lanes. I think it's especially unsafe there because I'm often moving faster than traffic and drivers don't always look behind them for a bike that's moving faster than they are.<br>When I have my kids with me on a cargo bike, I actually avoid using the bike lanes on Barnet for this reason - I take Aberdeen and go through the parking lot at Coquitlam Central instead. It's too bad that an investment was made in bike infrastructure that feels unsafe because it's not being used correctly by drivers.",
